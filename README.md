# RestApp-task
pre-interview task

    // Imagine this IRestClient is from 3rd party provider and you cannot change anything there.
    // Its implementation ThirdParty.RestClient is also part of external library and just being injected from DI.

// PROBLEM STATEMENT and DESIRED SOLUTION:
    // It's one of MANY classes within the solution that uses ThirdParty.IRestClient,
    // but unfortunately some of the API services we call are not very stable and we want to enhance all such usages with retry logic as below:
    // 1. By default we want to retry 3 times before failing, but the number should be configurable.
    // 2. There should be some timeout between retries(any rule works as for now, but ideally should be extensible).
    // 3. If System.Net.WebException is thrown, we want to retry, otherwise - we want to 'fail fast' without retrying.
    // 4. If System.Net.WebException is thrown after all attempts, we want to log it and return some 'null' or empty result, otherwise - we want to re-throw the original exception.
    // 5. We want to log the exception thrown, but we don't want to log 4 times if we retry.
    // 6. Ideally we don't want to change dozens of classes that use IRestClient to apply retry logic.
	// 7. Cover all the requirements by unit tests.
	// 8. Do not use some built-in or 3rd party solutions for retry policies like Polly
